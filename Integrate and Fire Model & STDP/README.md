The integrate-and-fire neuron model is one of the most widely used models for analyzing the behavior of neural systems. It describes the membrane potential of a neuron in terms of the synaptic inputs and the injected current that it receives.
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons in the brain.
