# Spike Trains
This coursework relates to the properties of Spike Train. A spike train is the sequence of neuronal firing timings, where a spike refers to the firing of an action potential. The temporal pattern of a spike train encodes information in various ways. Besides firing rates, the temporal pattern of spike timings also carries important information about brain functions.
